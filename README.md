# HW_2_1-Fahrenheight-converter
Problem 1: Write a program that declares a variable that represent a temperature in Fahrenheit degrees. Store some value in it.  Then the program should compute and outputs the corresponding degrees in Celsius.  
You should use the following mathematical formula (you need to adapt it to work in C#!):
            C=5/9 (F-32)
